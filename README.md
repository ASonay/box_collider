Try to find pi digits by colliding boxes in lab frame by counting how many collides happened between the accelerated box and an imaginary wall afterward.  

For g++ compiler :  

```
g++ -o calc_pi calc_pi.cpp
```

Run the code :

```
./calc_pi <stable box mass> <accelerated box mass> DEBUG
```

Have fun..
